  When asked about the highlight of his career, retired Brig. Gen. Kevin Nally,
  USMC, could provide a lot of different answers. The highlight, in his eyes,
  was mentoring young Marines and "passing on my knowledge and what I've learned
  from others so that they don't make the same mistakes and have the chance and
  the resources to succeed."
