            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Perfect 24 Hours, If I Were a Teleporting Billionaire | Travel Away</h1><p>Bear with me on this one. Let's say it's summer, end of August to be more precise. I live in Romania, I am a billionaire, and, of course, teleportation is possible. To make it easier for you to calculate (if you want to), use the Eastern European time (UTC+2).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d514394de715e2d49831dc9410ecb72b24380f6d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
